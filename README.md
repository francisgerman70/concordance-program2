# Description of files in this directory.



* ```makefile```: Needed to build the assignment. In order to
construct the ```kwoc3``` executable, enter either ```make``` or
```make kwoc3```.

* ```kwoc3.c```: The C file containing the ```main()``` function.
(There must only exist one ```main``` in any program.).

* ```emalloc.[ch]```: Source code and header file for the
```emalloc``` function described in lecture. This is kept in its own
source-code file as it can be used independently in both
```kwoc3.c``` and ```listy.c```.

* ```listy.[ch]```: Linked-list routines based on the lectures. The
routines here may be added to or modified.
